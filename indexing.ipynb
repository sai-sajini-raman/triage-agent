of CFTO Tracking App was to minimize the cost Customer had to pay as compensation to the disappointed customer and Brand damage caused by not being able to fulfil a Customer Order. This objective could be achieved by tracking CFTO customer orders through the supply chain and taking immediate remediation steps to correct the course in case of scarcity situations. Before tracking app was developed there was no way for the stakeholders (supply chain planners, logistics, stores) to get an early visibility of shortages from suppliers and inturn warn customers or staff/stores who will be affected by these issues. The solution provided was to build a system that will highlight where issues are occurring or that suppliers/primary consolidation sites are not following due process to allow the system to track their shipments. This gives interested stakeholders a near real-time view of the issues occurring in the system. This should give enough time for people to investigate and put in resolutions or inform affected stores/customers., Application Status: Decommissioned, Primary Product: Product Name : Supply Chain Visibility, Primary Product: Product Group: Food Product Flow, Primary Product: Product Portfolio: Food Supply Chain, Primary Product: Business Platform: Supply Chain, Business Criticality: Day 3, Hosting type: SaaS, DR Capability: Active-Passive, DR Tiering: , Support Hours: \\nApplication ID: A2140, Application Name: P2D Product Tracing, Alias: P2D, Description: To enable Suppliers to record the Product traces for the stock that are due to come into Customer depot and destination is EU (Brexit), Application Status: Live, Primary Product: Product Name : Food Export, Customs & Excise, Primary Product: Product Group: Product Flow, Primary Product: Product Portfolio: Food, Primary Product: Business Platform: Food, Business Criticality: Day 1, Hosting type: SaaS, DR Capability: Active-Passive, DR Tiering: , Support Hours: \\nApplication ID: A2143, Application Name: BrandBank, Alias: , Description: 3rd Party system which is used for product artwork file.
